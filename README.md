This method is from Cox, D. R., and H. S. Battey. "Large numbers of explanatory variables, a semi-descriptive analysis." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 114.32 (2017): 8592-8595.

It is useful when we have huge number of variables but few samples.

However, the simulation demonstrates that it's not very powerful in multivariate GWAS.
